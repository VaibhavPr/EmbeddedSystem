Project on Creating a Fire Alarm System using STM32F303RE and GSM SIM800L Module

This proposal suggests connecting the SIM800L module with the STM32 microcontroller to enable communication functions such as making calls and sending messages. This project uses a flame sensor to detect flames and send alert messages to a pre-coded number. This project has extensive usage potential in various fields, including security systems, industrial automation, remote sensing, and smart homes. Future prospects for this project include integrating additional features like GPS, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi to enable an end-to-end communications system. The project involves developing software to control the SIM800L module using the STM32 microcontroller, integrating, testing, and validation of the system's functionality along with other peripherals such as sensors and display (LCD). This project will provide an affordable and reliable communication system suitable for various applications
